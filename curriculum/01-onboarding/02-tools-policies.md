This course teaches students about the fundamentals of data science. This field is constantly evolving, and it would be impossible to introduce every tool in one workshop.

Instead, General Assembly provides a core set of objectives for this workshop, along with guidelines for how to ensure students reach these objectives. As an instructor, you have the opportunity and responsibility to adapt these recommendations to your local context and modify/expand on any of these tools as you see fit.


## Required Tools

- Bring a laptop with [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) installed. Scroll to your operating system version and click on the install button for ***Anaconda with Python 3.6***.
- If you are using a PC, please install the [git for windows terminal](https://git-for-windows.github.io).

## Optional Tools
These tools aren't required, but offer additional functionality that students may find helpful!

- Install a popular text editor, like [Atom](https://atom.io) or [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com).


## Technology Policy

General Assembly introduces students to concepts using the environment, tools, and ethics of the open-source community. We try to only use languages and tools that are open-source and free for commercial use.

#### Laptop Policy

We strongly suggest that everyone use Mac laptops, as most instructors will perform examples in (and use) Mac OS every day. In general, instructors will only be able to provide tech support for students with Macs. Please see our OS Policy below for further details.  

It is also our experience that students should have laptops with screens of at least 13-inches. Having an 11-inch (or smaller) screen has been shown to adversely affect student performance.


#### Operating Systems Policy

**Mac:** For those with Macs, you’ll need the Mac OS X 10.8.5 or higher. *This rules out some older MacBooks*

**PC/Linux:** For students on Windows, you’ll need to be using at least Microsoft Windows 8 or 10 (either 32 or 64 bit). Students are welcome to bring their own PC or Linux machines, but we **cannot guarantee tech support for these devices.**


#### Questions? Issues?

1. If you see elements you would like to add, improve, or change, please feel free to submit a **pull request** with your modifications! A member of our instructional team will make sure to review and merge applicable changes.

2. If you see bugs, typos, or other elements that need flagging, please file a **Github Issue**. A member of our instructional team will be sure to review and prioritize as needed.
